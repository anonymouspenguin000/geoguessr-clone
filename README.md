# GeoGuessr Clone

Clone ([TEMPORARILY CLOSED](#temporarily-closed)): https://geoguessr-clone.github.io/

## About
This is a clone of GeoGuessr, a popular geography game, where you need to guess the StreetView location. Initially,
this clone was written on Vanilla JS and jQuery with Gulp ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/anonymouspenguin000/Geoguessr-clone-old)).
But in a year I decided to rewrite it on React, so here it is. I also have some ideas to implement to make the clone
better.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a pirate. I didn't hack any sources. I don't cooperate with pirates or somebody else who's bad... I just took an
idea for my own and others' education/experience making web-apps and working with APIs. I don't monetize this project. I
encourage you to use the original.

## Wanna run it yourself?
Firstly, clone the repo to your computer and install the dependencies (`npm install`), but don't run yet. Create your Google
Cloud API Key and enable the Maps JavaScript API. It's free (with limits), you can find a lot of tutorials on the
internet. Go to your project folder, follow the `.env.example` file in the root and create the `.env` file with same
contents. Copy your API Key and place it after the "=" sign in your `.env` file (don't forget to save). Now you can run
the project (`npm start`) and open the URL the CLI says (usually it's `localhost:3000`). That's all :)

## TEMPORARILY CLOSED
The API key of geoguessr-clone.github.io has reached its req/mo limit, therefore the game prod is temporarily closed. While I'm working on it, you can try to run the code with your own API key ([described above](#wanna-run-it-yourself)). And if you're looking forward, check the game once a month.
